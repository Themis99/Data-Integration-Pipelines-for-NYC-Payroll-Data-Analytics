# Data Integration Pipelines for NYC Payroll Data Analytics
## project overview
The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics to accomplish two primary objectives:

Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
Make the data available to the interested public to show how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.

In this project a high-quality data pipelines that are dynamic, can be automated, and monitored for efficient operation will be created. The pipelines will also be tested by the city’s quality assurance experts who are part of the project team to identify any errors and improve overall data quality.

## Dataset
